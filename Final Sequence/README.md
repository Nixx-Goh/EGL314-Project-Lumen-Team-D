# 🏆 Final Sequence

As our Cadets face their final mission, Sector 536 also reaches the end of its journey. That is when 5 of our Agents from 4 teams present to you the Final Sequence. In this **Final Sequence**, you will witness a **Handmade Rocket** built entirely from cardboard, wrapped in glowing **NeoPixels**, brought to life with synchronized **lighting sequences** and **immersive audio**. *Captain Chromaflex* will have the honour to launch our **Handmade Rocket** to send us back to NYP. Here are the different elements that brought our **Final Sequence** to life.

# 🚀 About our Rocket
As **Project L.U.M.E.N** embarks on a space themed 🌌 project, we have decided to ensure that we will leave a lasting impact of Sector 536 for our Cadets. All we needed to do was to gather *large amount of cardboards as well as corrugated boards* to help us stabilise and support the weight of the Rocket. In order to secure everything together, we use *masking tape, gaffer tape and super glue*. We also cannot miss out on the overall design of our Rocket as well as colour scheme. We went with *white, red, blue* was because that was the official colour of Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP). Apart from that, we also decided that it will be creative if we made a opening at the bottom of the rocket for the flames to exit from, whereby when the rocket is lifted from the projector lift where it is tied, it would look very cute and realistic.🔥 To make the roof of the rocket, we decided to use trigonometry to decide on the best height for our rocket to ensure that it looks like a rocket. To make our rocket even nicer, we have decided to include our course name, Media Technology & Systems, 'MTS' at the front of our rocket as well as 'LUMEN' using printed out letters. We also decided to include our 2 favourite lecturers on the 'windows' of the rocket.
