# 🚀 Final Sequence

As our Cadets face their final mission, **Sector 536** also reaches the end of its journey. That is when 5 of our Agents from 4 teams present to you the **Final Sequence**. In this **Final Sequence**, you will witness a **Handmade Rocket** built entirely from cardboard, wrapped in glowing **NeoPixels**, brought to life with synchronized **lighting sequences** and **immersive audio**. Here are the different elements that brought our **Final Sequence** to life.
