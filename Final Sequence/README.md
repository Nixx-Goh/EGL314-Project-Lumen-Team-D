# 🏆 Final Sequence

As our Cadets face their final mission, Sector 536 also reaches the end of its journey. That is when 5 of our Agents from 4 teams present to you the Final Sequence. In this **Final Sequence**, you will witness a **Handmade Rocket** built entirely from cardboard, wrapped in glowing **NeoPixels**, brought to life with synchronized **lighting sequences** and **immersive audio**. *Captain Chromaflex* will have the honour to launch our **Handmade Rocket** to send us back to NYP. Here are the different elements that brought our **Final Sequence** to life.
